= Taggable cache

This gem simplifies cache expiration in rails by adding depends_on helper, which expires cache element when depending object is changed/deleted.

= How to use
For taggable-cache you must have redis server for data about tags. Cache storage can be anything, but gem uses redis for its own storage.

Controller(action caching):

  caches_action :index

  def index
    Page.load_lot_of_data

    #this depends on any Page object change - creation, deletion, change
    depends_on Page
  end

View(fragment caching):

  <%# Page.active can be AR scope, every Page object on change is checked if it is in this scope, and if is - expires cache element %>
  <% cache 'cache_entry', :depends_on => [Page.active] do %>
    <% Page.load_lot_of_data %>
  <% end %>

Usage with Rails.cache:

  page = Page.first
  #this cache key expires only if this Page object is changed/deleted
  Rails.cache.write('key', 'value', :depends_on => [page])

Usage with cells gem:

  class TabsCell < Cell::Rails
    cache :index, nil, :depends_on => [Category, Metacategory, Product]

    def index
      render
    end
  end

If you are using redis for cache, it is recommended to set default expire_ttl value:

    config.cache_store = ActiveSupport::Cache::RedisStore.new(:expire_in => 16.hours.to_i)

== What is supported

Rails 3.1.x and 3.2.x are supported. Tested with ruby 1.9.3, but should work on 1.8.7. As cache storage you can use redis, memcached and file store caches. 

== Contributing to taggable-cache
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
